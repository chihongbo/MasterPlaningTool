Calculate revenue miles based on GTFS file (stop_times.txt -> "shape_dist_traveled")

Note: not sure what length unit "shape_dist_traveled" is using
=> use stop 57012 to 57014 as example to calculate the ratio

- shape_dist_traveled from stop 57012 to 57014 = 0.7607 - 0.5519 = 0.2088
- distance from stop 57012 to 57014 measured using GIS tool = approx. 0.131 miles
=> 0.2088 / 0.131 = 1.59389312977
